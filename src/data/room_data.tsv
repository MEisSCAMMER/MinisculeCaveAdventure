0	0	Living room	This is the main room of your house. I'm kinda surprised that you needed me to describe your own house. Exits are to the north and east.
0	1	Kitchen	Weirdly for you, but conveniently for me, the kitchen is quite empty, meaning there are no objects to take or use here. Exits are to the south and east.
1	0	Roomy room	This is a room that is quite roomlike. Its majestic roomness impresses you. Exits are to the north and west.
1	1	Door room	There's a door here. You're surprised because you're used to boring old FEATURELESS rooms. Exits are to the south and west.
