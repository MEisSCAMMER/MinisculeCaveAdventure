0	0	Living room	This is the main room of a house. You note that you've never seen this house before. You wonder how you got here.	false
0	1	Kitchen	Weirdly for you, but conveniently for me, the kitchen is quite empty, meaning there are no objects to take or use here. Unless you put something here.	false
1	0	Roomy room	This is a room that is quite roomlike. Its majestic roomness impresses you.	false
1	1	Door room	There's a door here. You're surprised because you're used to boring old FEATURELESS rooms.	false
2	0	Bathroom	This is an empty room. You're meant to take baths in this room, which is why it's called a "bathroom". Clever, I know.	false
3	0	Dark room	Amazingly enough, there are no monsters. It really is just a darkroom used for photography.	true
